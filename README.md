Video is key to building online experiences that make your audience go, “Hey, I remember that brand out of a sea of other brands. And I kinda like them!” That’s where Mux comes in. We’re behind the powerful video infrastructure that companies like Robinhood, Equinox, and Hopin use to weave video seamlessly into their products.
 
We’ve always been big fans of Strapi’s flexible platform, so we teamed up to bring you a plug-in to add, delete, preview, manage, and program video (or audio) — all from Strapi’s Admin UI.
 
You can find our plug-in in the [Strapi Market](https://strapi.io/integrations/mux?utm_campaign=Strapi%20Conf%2022&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=212674335&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CxNn1z701P0tB5YJ9A8knHQYsKKLN-3p6Bp19MZIt4N1aEF6mcfwAyUNVDRUPjLCvrjXXyZ7eSGZr2RL5zzIqP1tOKg&utm_content=212674335&utm_source=hs_email) and have it up and running in [just a few steps](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/integrate-with-strapi?utm_campaign=Strapi%20Conf%2022&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=212674335&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9lDOERMGBa0XjoVYHx64MziGhcDFo0MCxmMLR7TQGqXrbnbL_0BBrwpSA7rvkCM3npScyqO31d_BT7iY9SIKOTqrHS6g&utm_content=212674335&utm_source=hs_email).
